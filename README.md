# **Ticket Booking - Highly Scalable Microservice App**

This Ticket Booking application is built using modern web technologies to deliver a robust and scalable solution for booking events. It leverages **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, **Express**, **Next.js** (for the frontend), **Redis**, and **NATS Streaming** for seamless event-driven communication. The app follows both **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, ensuring reliability and maintainability. Payment processing is integrated using **Stripe**. All services are containerized and managed with **Kubernetes**, with persistent storage using **volumes**.

In the payment service, there is an **expiration period** to ensure timely transactions. For example, once a ticket is reserved, it will remain reserved for **15 minutes**. If the payment is not completed within this timeframe, the order will **expire** and the ticket will be released.

Run the following command to install the Nginx ingress controller:
`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.12.0-beta.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml`


4. **Create necessary secrets (environment variables):**  
- Create the **JWT secret**:
  ```
  kubectl create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=JWT_KEY=topSecretJWTKey
  ```
- Create any additional secrets as defined in the `.yml` files.

5. **Run the app:**
- If **Skaffold** is installed:
  ```
  skaffold dev
  ```
